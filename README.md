# chevron.loggers

Loggers is a blindingly simple logger implementing PSR-3.

Read up on PSR-3 and you'll be just fine. Consider using monolog--that's *apparently* what all
the cool kids are using.

Peruse the tests or, if present, the examples directory to see usage.

See [packagist](https://packagist.org/packages/chevron/loggers) for version/installation info. At the moment, I recommend using `~4.0`.
