# chevron.loggers

Chevron aims to be a 'simple set of useful tools'. This means that it
exists as a humble collection of code I've written and found quite useful.

Chevron.loggers is a blindingly simple logger implementing PSR-3 and the
chevron.db PDOWrapperInterface.

# usage

If there isn't an examples dir, look through the tests. In this case there aren't any,
read up on PSR-3 and you'll be just fine. Consider using monolog--that's what all
the cool kids are doing.

# installation

Using [composer](http://getcomposer.org/) `"require" : { "henderjon/chevron-loggers": "2.*" }`

# where is version 1.*?

Packagist (an important component to the composer ecosystem) prefers dashes as separators (I was
using dots). I had to update all the package names accordingly.

# license

See LICENSE.md for the [BSD-3-Clause](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) license.
